## Features

- **Object Detection**: The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to accurately detect objects within its detection range.

- **Auditory Feedback**: When an object is detected, a buzzer produces a distinct sound to notify the user.

- **Visual Indicator**: A LED light provides a visual cue, illuminating when an object is found.

- **Servo Motor**: The servo motor can be integrated for directional scanning, expanding the system's coverage.

## Usage

1. **Setup**:
   - Connect the components following the provided schematic.

2. **Power On**:
   - Power up the system using an appropriate power source.

3. **Object Detection**:
   - Place an object within the detection range of the ultrasonic sensor.

4. **Feedback**:
   - When an object is detected, the buzzer will emit a sound, and the LED will light up.

5. **Adjustments (Optional)**:
   - Fine-tune the sensitivity or range settings in the Arduino code if needed.
